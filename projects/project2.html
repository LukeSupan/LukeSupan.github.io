            <h3>My Experience With Comet Contacts</h3>
            <p> Comet Contacts was my first team-based web dev experience. I did it over the Summer for a "Proccesses for Object Oriented Software Development, and it taught me a lot about working on a team as well as some basic tools.</p>
            <p> This was a LAMP stack site, so the structure is fairly simple and this made it so much easier to learn the basic tools of web dev.</p>

            <p> I worked as the lead front-end dev for the project and was in charge of everything related to design. I came up with the name, I made the color pallette, I decided the entire look of the site. As seen above</p>
            <p> We made the site in around two weeks and presented it live in class where it was recieved well for the pagination and overall design.</p>
            <p> Our second project ScreenBuddy was overall more impressive, but I enjoyed the simplicity of this project and I learned a lot of basics. When I learn something I like to really get used to the basics before moving on to higher level skills, this project helped with that.</p>
