            <h2>My Experience With Comet Contacts</h2>
            <p> Comet Contacts was my first team-based web dev experience. I did it over the Summer for "Processes for Object Oriented Software Development", and it taught me a lot about working on a software development team as well as some basic tools.</p>
            <p> This was a LAMP stack site, so the structure is fairly simple and this made it so much easier to learn parts of web dev I didn't know like databases and APIs while using things I was familiar with like HTML and CSS.</p>
            <img src="../cometContactsSlides.png" alt="Comet Contacts lighthouse report">
            <p> I worked as the lead front-end dev for the project and was in charge of everything related to design. I came up with the name, I made the color pallette, I decided the entire look of the site. The lighthouse report slide above shows a bit of the work I did.</p>
            <p> We made the site in around two weeks and presented it live in class where it was recieved well for the inclusion of pagination and overall design.</p>
            <p> Our second project ScreenBuddy was overall more impressive, but I enjoyed the simplicity of this project and I learned a lot about web development. When I learn something I like to get very familiar with the basics before moving on to higher level skills, this project allowed me to do that.</p>
