            <h2>My Experience Making PONG</h2>
            <p>I decided to make PONG after a class on Unity I took at UCF. It was a fun course but I wanted some solo practice to really understand Unity, C# and game dev. Pong seemed like a fairly simple game to remake to meet those goals.</p>
            <p>I had a lot of the bones done pretty quickly. The players movement was solid and I managed to get it working on controller too with Unity's input system. I could launch the ball and had the round restart when it reached each side of the screen. These were all pretty straight forward tasks with box colliders and some scripts.</p>
            <p>I spent the bulk of my time making the enemy AI, which was my favorite part, but I also really enjoyed figuring out the physics. I tried using Unity's built in bounce physics but it didn't act like Pong to me at all. Most Pong remakes I see use the built in physics, but it's not fun to play with. I watched a few clips of official Pong and realized that the ball basically just launched in a straight line from the middle of the paddle to its location when it hit the ball, so if the ball hit the top the ball would shoot off at a pretty tight angle. This was pretty easy to replicate with some basic trig, and that was all I needed to do for physics.</p>

            <p>The AI went through a few iterations and lots of minor tweaks. It was probably 80-90 percent of the dev time, luckily it was extremely fun. At first I had the enemy paddle go to the current Y location of the ball, but this made it jitter pretty heavily and even after fixing that it made the game far too easy. I ended up using raycasts. The ball would shoot out a ray in front of it; this would show where the ball would land on the enemy's side, then I would just send the paddle there after a short delay and with a random inaccuracy. I fine tuned these numbers until I would win about 50 percent of the time.</p>
            <p>This is easily my favorite project. Video games are my favorite form of media and my biggest hobby. I plan to make a 2D platformer when I have the time, but even making PONG was quite the time sink.</p>

                I've heard from most people that they find the singleplayer extremely hard. I've now realized that I overtuned the enemy AI because of how much practice I had while making the game, so good luck.
